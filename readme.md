# Open User Map

**This is a clone of the [Open User Map](https://wordpress.org/plugins/open-user-map/) WordPress plugin by By [100plugins](https://www.open-user-map.com/). All credit goes to [100plugins](https://profiles.wordpress.org/100plugins/) and other Open Source contributors.**

Create a custom map featuring your own locations or an interactive map where anyone can add location pins without registering. New locations will wait for your approval before getting published. 

The map is based on [Leaflet Map JS](https://leafletjs.com/?target=_blank) and offers you many free map and marker styles. You do not need an API Key, Access Token or any other external registration (like Google). Additionally you have access to awesome MapBox map styles.

## 👩🏾‍🚀🤵👩🏻‍🎤👩🏽‍🌾👩🏿‍💻 How to create an Interactive Map

Create a community map! Visitors to your page can add new location markers to the map. You will receive a notification to approve each location before it is published. Your visitors can **search for addresses or markers** worldwide to quickly find the right spots. You can add **custom fields** and descriptions to the form to collect the data you need. Image and audio uploads are possible and much more. Let your users collaborate!

### How your website visitors add new markers to your map:

Just by clicking a "+"-Button a form will popup to let the visitor enter location details the same comfortable way you can do it in the backend. After submit the location proposal will be "pending" and wait for your review approval to get published.

## 🆕 Regions

Add regional navigation tabs and let your visitors 'fly' back and forth between locations that are far apart from each other. See the [Demo Map](https://www.open-user-map.com/demo/?target=_blank).
