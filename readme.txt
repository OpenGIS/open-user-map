Create a customizable, simple or interactive map. Anyone can add new markers without registering — perfect for collaborative and community projects.

== Description ==

Create a custom map featuring your own locations or an interactive map where anyone can add location pins without registering. New locations will wait for your approval before getting published. 

The map is based on [Leaflet Map JS](https://leafletjs.com/?target=_blank) and offers you many free map and marker styles. You do not need an API Key, Access Token or any other external registration (like Google). Additionally you have access to awesome MapBox map styles.

= 👩🏾‍🚀🤵👩🏻‍🎤👩🏽‍🌾👩🏿‍💻 How to create an Interactive Map =

Create a community map! Visitors to your page can add new location markers to the map. You will receive a notification to approve each location before it is published. Your visitors can **search for addresses or markers** worldwide to quickly find the right spots. You can add **custom fields** and descriptions to the form to collect the data you need. Image and audio uploads are possible and much more. Let your users collaborate!

= How your website visitors add new markers to your map: =
Just by clicking a "+"-Button a form will popup to let the visitor enter location details the same comfortable way you can do it in the backend. After submit the location proposal will be "pending" and wait for your review approval to get published.

= 🆕 Regions =

Add regional navigation tabs and let your visitors 'fly' back and forth between locations that are far apart from each other. See the [Demo Map](https://www.open-user-map.com/demo/?target=_blank).

=== 🚀 PRO ===
The Open User Map plugin is also available in a professional version which includes more styles, more funtionality and more flexibility!

- **Filterable Marker Categories**
Organize locations in multiple filterable marker groups. Each group (category) can have an individual marker icon and will be accessible to visitors.

- **More custom field types**
Add custom fields like links, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns and even HTML. Social media links will automatically be rendered as icons.

- **Additional geosearch providers (Geoapify, Here, MapBox)**

- **Export & Import locations**
Maybe you already have a list of places you need to show on the map. No problem - just make use of the CSV Export & Import feature. This also comes in handy for bulk editing a lot of locations.

- **Email user notification**
Users get notified by email after their location has been approved.

- **Email Admin notification**
Send notifications to an Admin email account on incoming location proposals.

- **User restriction**
Restrict "Add location" feature to registered users only. Redirect your visitors to the registration form.

- **Auto-publish**
When activated registered users will publish directly without admin approval. This can also be enabled for unregistered users.

- **Extend user registration**
Integrate the "Add location" feature to the WordPress user registration form.

- **Custom filesizes**
Customize max. filesize for image/audio uploads (default: 10MB).

- **Custom marker icons**
Use your own custom marker icon.

- **Custom UI Elements color**
Pick a color for buttons and icons that fits your theme.

- **Current location**
Add a button that relocates the map to the users current location.

- **Limit visible locations**
You can limit the locations to be shown by marker categories and by post ids. So it is possible to show only locations of a specific type or to render only one single location. This can be done in the block settings or with shortcode attributes.

- **Single pages for locations**
Per default locations will not have a single page. This should ensure that all the locations wont negatively affect your SEO. But if you'd like to add more content to locations you can easily enable it in the PRO version.

- **Default template for Single pages**
If Single pages are enabled locations will automatically have a post thumbnail, an excerpt as well as a default content template. And you can show locations within query loop blocks to setup your own list or grid view.

- **Shortcodes for single location values**
Use the shortcode [open-user-map-location value="YOUR VALUE" post_id="POST ID (optional)"] to easily display a value from a location. You will need this when creating single pages for locations. See all the available values in the Help section of the plugin settings (Open User Map > Settings > Help).

- **Show all location images as gallery**
Use the shortcode [open-user-map-gallery] to get a nice gallery view of all the location images. Each image is linked to the location marker on the map.

- **Show all locations as list or grid**
Use the shortcode [open-user-map-list] to get a list view of all the locations. Alternatively you can use the native query loops block to build a custom list or grid.

- **Allow registered users to edit their locations**
Open User Map PRO extends WordPress capabilities to allow backend access. If assigned to the user role registered users get access to read, edit and delete their locations from within the backend.

== Installation ==
From your WordPress dashboard

1. Visit Plugins > Add New
2. Search for “Open User Map”
3. Install and activate Open User Map from your Plugins page

5. You can manage locations in the “Open User Map” menu.
6. You can manage styles and features under "Open User Map > Settings".

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I need an API Key or some external registration? =
No, the plugin is based on Leaflet.js and offers you free map styles that don’t need any kind of registration.

= How to integrate the map? =
Use the page editor or Elementor to insert the "Open User Map" block or just place the shortcode `[open-user-map]` anywhere in your content. Or integrate it within your theme template with PHP:

`echo do_shortcode("[open-user-map]")`

you can also override the initial map focus with shortcode attributes:

`[open-user-map lat="51.50665732176545" long="-0.12752251529432854" zoom="13"]`

= Can I set the initial map position individualy? =
If you want to override the initial map focus (settings) just use the shortcode with attributes:

`[open-user-map lat="51.50665732176545" long="-0.12752251529432854" zoom="13"]`

= Can I limit locations to a specific Marker Category only? =
Yes, just add the "types" attribute to the shortcode:

`[open-user-map lat="51.50665732176545" long="-0.12752251529432854" zoom="13" types="food|drinks"]`

= Can I show only specific locations? =
Yes, just add the "ids" attribute to the shortcode:

`[open-user-map lat="51.50665732176545" long="-0.12752251529432854" zoom="13" ids="123"]`

= Do I need GPS coordinates? =
No. Add a new location simply by droping a marker on the map. You can search for addresses as well. If you want to use GPS coordinates though, there is an option for that.

= I want my own fields. Is this possible? =
Yes. You can add custom fields in the settings and use them instead of "subtitle" and "description".

= Can I use Gutenberg? =
Yes! You will find the "Open User Map"-Block under widgets.

= Can I use Elementor? =
Yes! You will find the "Open User Map"-Widget. The minimum required Elementor version is 3.7.0. PHP needs to be at least version 7.3.

= Can I use marker clustering? =
Yes! This is enabled by default. You can disable it in the settings.

= Can I search for Markers? =
Yes, you can. Just enable the "Search for Markers" feature which will render a button or full searchbar on the map. It is a fulltext search.

= Can I go fullscreen? =
Yes! There is a fullscreen control button on the top left of the map. You can disable it in the settings.

= Can I use custom styles? =
Yes, we encourage you to do so. This plugin is supposed to be developer friendly. Feel free to override the .open-user-map class in css to create your own awesome design.

= Can my users upload audio files? =
Yes! This is a new fun feature. Your visitors can upload mp3, wav, mp4 and m4a files and after your approval little audio players will be attached to the locations. The world needs soundmaps!

= Is there a max. filesize for image/audio uploads? =
Yes, per default it is 10MB. You customize that with the PRO version. Be aware that that you may need to increase **upload_max_filesize** and **post_max_size** on your server accordingly as they set the general limit for uploading files.

= Can I disable specific form fields? =
Yes, all default form fields can be disabled. You can use custom fields.

= Can the "link" field handle multiple URLs? =
Yes. They need to be separated with the | symbol.

= How can I access field values of a location? =
Use this shortcode (PRO)

`[open-user-map-location value="YOUR VALUE" post_id="POST ID (optional)"]` 

to display a value from a location. You will need this when creating single pages for locations. See all the available values in the Help section of the plugin settings (Open User Map > Settings > Help & Getting started).

= How to allow registered users to manage their locations? =
Make use of these capabilities: 'edit_oum-locations', 'edit_published_oum-locations' and 'delete_oum-locations'. Additionally you need to ensure the user has 'upload_files' capability if you want them to edit/upload images in the backend.
You can assign them to any user role with plugins like e.g. User Role Manager.

= Can I automatically open a location (eg. for sharing)? =
Add ?markerid=123 to the URL to auto-open a specific location. 123 can be the post_id of any public location.

= The map doesn't show up with content preloading. =
Some themes/plugins make use of content preloading. This can break the loading of the OUM map. In this rare case please disable preloading for the map section. Alternatively you could manually trigger the oumMap.invalidateSize() method after the content has been loaded. This reinits the OUM map.

= How can I import/export locations to CSV? =
There is a Import & Export feature available in the PRO version. 

= Can I use condtionial fields? =
Yes, there is an (experimental) feature available. It can be done with a Javascript function. Find more details in the Help section (Open User Map > Settings > Help & Getting Started).

= How do I use WordPress Hooks? =
Open User Map includes Hooks to let you customize the code. Please see details and examples in the Help section (Open User Map > Settings > Help & Getting Started).

= Can I use ACF fields? =
Yes, you could use the Advanced Custom Fields plugin to extend the WordPress user registration form with your own fields. Please see Open User Map > Settings > Help & Getting Started > Hooks to learn how to show these field values inside the location bubble.

= I want to submit a feature request. =
Please do so! You can use the support forum to let us know about your ideas helping to make this plugin better.
